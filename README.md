# Medical Appointment No-Show Prediction App

This is an interactive web application built with Streamlit to analyze and predict patient no-shows for medical appointments.

The app has two main sections:
1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Interactive visualizations to explore the factors influencing no-shows.
2.  **Make a Prediction:** A form to input new patient data and receive a real-time prediction on whether the patient will show up.
